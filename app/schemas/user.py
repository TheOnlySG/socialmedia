'''
we are not putting id , and created_at in here
as we dod for user.py . why ? 
as they wont be entered by user , id is auto
increment and datetime is auto set current utc time


username , email , password are the fields
which the user will enter while registering 
and are important for his profile

#class for response

    '''
    so basically we would be returning the orm object (new_user) from the api right ? 
    but we need to take permission of orm from that . as orm (sqlalchemy) wont direclty
    allow returning a model obejct . soo this statement handles that.
    '''


    #these are the things which would be returned throught the api

    id  : int
    username : str
    email : str
    created_at : datetime

    '''
    we will probably add the response model in route.post('/signup' , *HERE*) as an argument so
    api knows what object we returning and molds accordingly
