this readme currently holds my journey for building a social media app. and i use it to maintain 
a track on my progress so you can totally ignore it for now ! :)


# project updates

we have loaded our database url inside of app/core/config.py , using dotenv loader
os.load_env thingy

main connection of ORM is in folder
app/db/database.py


tables created :
users(id (PK) , username , base )


so  how does the flow work ? 
1. models imported
2. create_all() will get metadata
3. sqlalchemy writes queries
4. postgres creates table.



i also added get_db to database.py , explained the purpose of it there.

alr so fornow we are done with a model , but we need to validate it . what does that mean ? 
well lets break it down.
what did we create now , the model ? its user right ? something like class ...(Base): , its a
sqlalchemy inherited class right ? this would be the database representation , or in simple words
the table.
before inserting values , dont we need to validate it ? same datatype , same format and stuff ? 
this is where pydantic comes in , inbuilt in fastapi btw.
soo it has its own Base thingy , which can be inherited the same way as we did for our orm model.

what exactly will it do. it will define 
1. What api Expects 
2. Validation rules
3. response shaper.

    BASICALLY API LAYER



soo lets simply give a 1 worder for it:

pydantic will validate the input , is it correct ? does it fit our orm model ? if yes
then we push it over to our database from sqlalchemy model . simple.
check schemas folder for **validation** model

sqlalchemy -> database structure
pydantic -> api input output structure


great now we have a dummy user storage model . wait , why did i call it dummy ? 
well we cant directly store passwords in database , right ? that will probably make
security vernareble if some of the data leaks , passwords are exposed.
solution - we use password hashing , and for that we use passlib[bycrypt]

let me break the wroking of it .
say our password is -- and our password hashed string is --
password123 => $2b$12$asdasdjasd...
and now we compare hashed strings. match ? return from server the required page !

bycrypt is a password hashing algorithm , not encription btw , both are different,

in bycryption , you cant reverse your password , means
once the password got hashed , you cant convert the hashing back to password.
example : 
password123 => $2b$12$asdasdjasd... , now this hashed thing cant be converted back to password

but , encryption is reversible.it is used for messeging , files etc.

also , deep down bycryption hashing is broken into fast hashing and slow hashing , 
fast hashing -> fast and quick hashed password. 
slow hashing -> slow but reliable and perfect hashed password.

hackers can try millions of password per sec to break a fast hashed password , but slow hashed cant be done

also , it uses salt , now wth is salt ? 
well if another user enters same password , then their hash wont be same.


alr enough explaination
so i have now updated the users.py from both db and api.routes . Thus , both validation model and
orm model are updated and yeah , "same synced" if we keep it simple.

NOW NOW NOW , earlier the postgres table stored password,  butnow , the table stores password_hash.
fair. but the table now alter exists and our sqlalchemy cant update an existing table. 
sooo here , a concept is introduced called migration , (well i pretty much understood the core
why, what , where for migration)
we would be using alembic for doing so btw. 
**BUT**
not now , for now i am simply dropping table from postgres manually.

UPDATE - faced an issue with bcrypt lib , was version issue , degraded the version a lil
well i guess we gotto use containerize this thing once complete , not thinking of it now.

anyways , now , what apis return ? they return jsons or other data formated things which we use for
frontend later , but rn our route is returning some string, lets change it , and give it a format

well we used pydantic to validate right , the UserCreate model , now we create somethinglike a 
UserResponse thingy , and we will return an objejct of that from api. thus frontend wont be able
to access any of our password hashes or important things we needed

alr now , we are entering **authentication**
currently situation ->
the user signsup , after that ? backend forgets it ! as every request is independent

example.. /signup -> user createde  
after that /profile -> who are you ?

lets implement the login setup first

alr so in orm , we did db.add(user) through which we added data , now
how do we fetch data ? , we do db.query(user) , basically means select * from users where "the user
object variables match the columns values of table"


alr now i have handled /login , back to jwt

soo rn our /login route api returns user , which holds id and all details
great , does our project currently store anything by which we can simply know that yeah this user
logined ? nope.
and that is what we gonna solve using JWT(json web token) , basically acts as an id card .
for that , i have added to new things in .env
secret key , and an algorithm.

soo what exactly is the secret key ? 
imagine , a login is done. and backend returned smth like {
    user : 1
}
hackers can easily edit it to user : 909 ? right ? soo secret key acts as a signature.
it has nothing to do with frontend it just stays as a signature in backend.
thus
client sends a jwt token , backend first checks the signature(our secret key) , is it fine ? 
well great , move ahead.
thus , frontend will stay disconnected and safe from hackers. they cant directly request data from
frontend.

soo jwt is more like , proving that this data was issued by our backend and wasent modified.
what algorithm ?? its basicaaly the algorithm whihc jwt use to generate the signature, there are
options but we gonna use this one as this generate signature and perfect for our sinario
we gonna use python-jose and cryptography for jwt ,

whats a payload ? payload is basically the data we wanna carry into our jwt , 
basically the data which we wanna share and expose to frontend through backend , example user_id

ALR jwt implementation done.
current jwt structure is {
    access_token : 'header.payload.key'
    token_tyle : bearer
}

now , i have also imnplementd a verification function in security whigch verifies the jwt
we will use that when we recieve token from frontend, if it verifies successfully then we proceed

now , where do we find  jwt ? we will find it in url header of the page , to take that ill
probably use inbuilt fastapis httpbearer

alr authentication chapter ended

we heading towards social media features now
now our backend already knows "who is performing this action"

next feature : posts
we need user->createpost

before building , what should a post contain ? 
1. id (post id)
2. content
3. created_at
4. user_id (as post belongs to user) 

its a one to many or 1:n relationship , and we gonna build that using orm
soo yeah , this posts.user_id is foreignkey to users.user_id
